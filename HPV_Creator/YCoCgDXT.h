Based on code by J.M.P. van Waveren / id Software, Inc.
and changes by Chris Sidhall / Electronic Arts

My changes are trivial:
- Remove dependencies on other EAWebKit files
- Mark unexported functions as static
- Refactor to eliminate use of a global variable
- Revert Chris Sidhall's C++ function overloading for C
- Correct spelling of NVIDIA_7X_HARDWARE_BUG_FIX macro
- Remove single usage of an assert macro

	\Function    CompressYCoCgDXT5( const byte *inBuf, byte *outBuf, const int width, const int height, const int stride )

	\Description        This is the C version of the YcoCgDXT5.

	Input data needs to be converted from ARGB to YCoCg before calling this function.

	Does not support alpha at all since it uses the alpha channel to store the Y (luma).

	The output size is 4:1 but will be based on rounded up texture sizes on 4 texel boundaries
	So for example if the source texture is 33 x 32, the compressed size will be 36x32.

	The DXT5 compresses groups of 4x4 texels into 16 bytes (4:1 saving)

	The compressed format:
	2 bytes of min and max Y luma values (these are used to rebuild an 8 element Luma table)
	6 bytes of indexes into the luma table
	3 bits per index so 16 indexes total
	2 shorts of min and max color values (these are used to rebuild a 4 element chroma table)
	5 bits Co
	6 bits Cg
	5 bits Scale. The scale can only be 1, 2 or 4.
	4 bytes of indexes into the Chroma CocG table
	2 bits per index so 16 indexes total

	\Input              const byte *inBuf   Input buffer of the YCoCG textel data
	\Input              const byte *outBuf  Output buffer for the compressed data
	\Input              int width           in source width
	\Input              int height          in source height
	\Input              int stride          in source in buffer stride in bytes

	\Output             int ouput size

	\Version    1.1     CSidhall 01/12/09 modified to account for non aligned textures
	1.2     1/10/10 Added stride

	\Function    DeCompressYCoCgDXT5( const byte *inBuf, byte *outBuf, const int width, const int height, const int stride )

	\Description  Decompression for YCoCgDXT5
	Bascially does the reverse order of he compression.

	Ouptut data still needs to be converted from YCoCg to ARGB after this function has completed
	(probably more efficient to convert it inside here but have not done so to stay closer to the orginal
	sample code and just make it easier to follow).

	16 bytes get unpacked into a 4x4 texel block (64 bytes output).

	The compressed format:
	2 bytes of min and max Y luma values (these are used to rebuild an 8 element Luma table)
	6 bytes of indexes into the luma table
	3 bits per index so 16 indexes total
	2 shorts of min and max color values (these are used to rebuild a 4 element chroma table)
	5 bits Co
	6 bits Cg
	5 bits Scale. The scale can only be 1, 2 or 4.
	4 bytes of indexes into the Chroma CocG table
	2 bits per index so 16 indexes total


	\Input          const byte *inBuf
	\Input          byte *outBuf,
	\Input          const int width
	\input          const int height
	\input          const int stride for inBuf

	\Output         int size output in bytes


	\Version    1.0        01/12/09 Created
	1.1        12/21/09 Alex Mole: removed branches from tight inner loop
	1.2        11/10/10 CSidhall: Added stride for textures with different image and canvas sizes.
